|Feature Name     |Description     |
|-----|-----|
|Lambda expression     |A function that can be shared or referred to as an object.     |
|Functional Interfaces    |Single abstract method interface.     |
|Method References     |Uses function as a parameter to invoke a method.     |
|Default method     |It provides an implementation of methods within interfaces enabling 'Interface evolution' facilities.     |
|Stream API     |Abstract layer that provides pipeline processing of the data.     |
|Date Time API     |New improved joda-time inspired APIs to overcome the drawbacks in previous versions     |
|Optional                  |Wrapper class to check the null values and helps in further processing based on the value.                                                                                        |
|Nashorn, JavaScript Engine                          |An improvised version of JavaScript Engine that enables JavaScript executions in Java, to replace Rhino.                                                                                                                                                                                  |


<b>Lambda expressions:</b>
<br>Lambda expressions basically express instances of functional interfaces (An interface with single abstract method is called functional interface. An example is java.lang.Runnable). lambda expressions implement the only abstract function and therefore implement functional interfaces

lambda expressions are added in Java 8 and provide below functionalities.

1) Enable to treat functionality as a method argument, or code as data.
2) A function that can be created without belonging to any class.
3) A lambda expression can be passed around as if it was an object and executed on demand.
